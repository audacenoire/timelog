# timelog
A simple Python script that outputs timestamps to a CSV. 

You may need to use pip to install the imported modules. 

Required packages: 
	datetime: For managing the timestamp
	pathlib: For managing paths
	keyboard: for monitoring keypresses
	threading: for multithreading commands
	tkinter, ttk: For GUI
  
  In the future I plan to add support for hardware buttons.
